                                    <h3 class="sub_head">REMEDIAL COACHING</h3>
                                    College is providing regular remedial coaching to the slow learners. Remedial
                                    coaching is undertaken by individual lecturers of each department to provide some
                                    extra academic help to slow learners and those students who have been observed to
                                    score consistently low marks in the internal examinations. These students are
                                    re-taught parts of the syllabus that they could not follow in the classes. Certain
                                    additional assignments and tests are administered to them to ascertain their
                                    progress in learning the concepts that they could not master during the class
                                    lectures and continuous internal assessments. These classes are generally held in
                                    the sixth hour. Students lacking in confidence to ask questions during class hours
                                    also benefit from these classes as they are able to put forth their queries freely
                                    in smaller groups. An important skill that students with poor writing skills learn
                                    during these classes is the art of organizing the points in an essay-type answer as
                                    per the requirements of the question. Remedial coaching has been shown to improve
                                    the performance of those students who struggle to keep up with the demands of the
                                    syllabus in the semester system

                                    backgrounds and those who face minor challenges with language are particularly able
                                    to benefit from this course.

                                    by the college and the trained teachers of our college. The counselor helps students

                                    between the counselor and the client. This kind of collaboration helps the clients
                                    identify goals and potential solutions to the problems which cause emotional

                                    family problems etcâ€¦ The counselor provides guidance and advice on solving the
                                    problems through the counseling sessions. The information shared by the students
                                    during the personal counseling sessions is kept confidential and dealt with
                                    compassionately. The Counseling Cell of the college takes care of all the counseling
                                    related activities. They make up the core body that deals with issues faced by the
                                    students and provide early interventions, help and support to them.

                                    Good communication skills are indispensable for the success of any professional. If
                                    one wants to reach out to people, he or she has to speak their language. The English
                                    language, in particular, has become essential in the lives of young people who
                                    aspire to advance their careers anywhere in the world. English language learning has

                                    language fluency. It encourages sound listening and speaking abilities. Reading
